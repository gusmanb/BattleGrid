# BattleGrid

In this repository you will find the source code for my latest game for the ZX Spectrum: BattleGrid.
You can do whatever you want with it except resell it.

The graphics and maps for the game are created with my [Reource Designer](https://github.com/gusmanb/ResourceDesigner) using the [BT map editor plugin](https://github.com/gusmanb/ResourceDesigner/tree/master/BTMapEditorPlugin) so you can download it and modify everything at your will.

Have fun!
